                    <h4>Why Should You Use To-Do Lists</h4>
                    <p>A to-do list is simply a list of all of the tasks you need to complete during
                        a particular period of time. For instance, at the beginning of the day, you 
                        might jot down on a sticky note all of the tasks you want to complete before 
                        the end of the day. That becomes your to-do list. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>What’s great about a to-do list</h4>
                    <p>
                    Now that we’ve covered some of the most common reasons why people don’t use 
                    a to-do list, let’s look at why you should have one.</p>

                    <h4>It will help you feel good</h4>
                    <p>Writing things down helps reduce stress and makes you feel more relaxed. 
                        You get a feeling of being in control of your life and actions.
                        Also, crossing items off your to-do list gives you a sense of accomplishment and progress. 
                        This helps you motivate yourself and keep going when things get tough.

                    <h4>It will help you achieve big goals</h4>
                    <p>It’s tough to achieve big goals when they seem to overwhelm you. As a consequence, it’s easy to 
                        procrastinate on them. One of the best ways to solve this problem is by breaking down a large goal into 
                        smaller parts. This is where a to-do list becomes significant. It lets you make large and overwhelming projects manageable.
